1. Data cleaning
Actions for label (questionnaire response):
    - Drop irrelevant columns from the row table of the questionnaire (E.g. Attachments % calculation, timestemp, empty columns)
    - Drop rows (participants) with missing data
    - Zscore Scaling for traits responses
Actions for features (smartphone data):
    - Retrieve Excel row data
    - Drop rows of users (participants) with missing data (E.g. not collected 7 days, missing logs, etc.)
2. Feature generation
We created the feature based on 2 aggregation level, week and day (24h)
Nulls handling: we replaced nulls values with feature median, for some features we replaced nulls values with feature mean (E.g. Screen_avg_time_24, calls_duration_mean_week, calls_duration_mean_24h)
Outliersâ€™ detection & removal: we used IQR approach to detect outliers, and we replaced outliers with feature median.
Data scaling: we scaled all features using Z-score method.
